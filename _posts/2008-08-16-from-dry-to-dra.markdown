The longer Christian and me (Mathias) are working on our Rails project (<a title="deineschokoladen.com" href="http://www.deineschokoladen.com" target="_self">www.deineschokoladen.com</a>) the more we two realize that our way of working is different. When I have a problem I sit down and start programming, whereas Christian asks google if there exists any plugin/module/snippet that solves the problem. After several month I have to admit that my way of thinking was alright when I was still working with PHP but in Rails Christians way is much more efficient. So we were thinking about the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and we came to the conclusion that its not only about "yourself", as so many things are already done, it should be: <strong>DRA (Don't Repeat Anything)</strong>
