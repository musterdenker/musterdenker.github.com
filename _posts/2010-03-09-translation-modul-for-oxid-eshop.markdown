Today is the release of a new open source module for OXID eShop. The module enables inline translation of all text not stored in the database. Creating a new language is very easy. The translator can simple click through the shop and translate the text directly in the context. Another good use for this module in real projects is the fixation of the wording. Because it's always the same. In the final phase of a project there are a lot requests like "I want this button labled 'basket' and not 'shopping cart' ...". With this inline editor the shop owner can make this changes himself. Another nice point about this module is that it comes along with gettext support. So it uses *.po files to store all translations. This po files are much better to handle that the default lang.php arrays, especially when you work together with external translators.

The original descriptions as written in exchange:
<blockquote>With this extension an small icon is displayed next to each translated string directly in the shop frontend. Clicking on this icons opens a window where you can enter the new translation for this language constant. That's it! In order to work this module includes gettext support for the shop. So if you want to use *.po files you can also use this module. Inline editing is only visible for shop admin. Please leave a comment or make improvements to the code. After all it's open source :)</blockquote>
